## 📌 What is Hosting?

- Hosting is renting a **remote computer (server)** to store and serve my website files online.
- Once I link those files with a domain → my website becomes globally accessible.

## 🖥️ Types of Hosting (with Examples)

| Type              | Description                                        | When I'd Use It                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Shared Hosting    | Many sites on one server. Cheap, basic resources.  | Small blogs or portfolios        |
| VPS Hosting       | Slice of a server just for me. Good performance.   | My full-stack projects           |
| Dedicated Hosting | Whole server for one site. Powerful & pricey.      | Large e-commerce or enterprise   |
| Cloud Hosting     | Uses cloud infrastructure. Scalable and reliable.  | For apps expecting traffic spikes|

 **VPS(Virtual Private Server)** is recommended for intermediate devs building backend/full-stack apps.
