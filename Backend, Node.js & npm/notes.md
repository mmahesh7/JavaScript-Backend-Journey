Day 0 of my backend journey. I mean i am just getting started with my setup....

## ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Covered So Far
- âœ… Introduction to Backend Development
- âœ… Installed Node.js and npm
- âœ… Ran my first JavaScript file with `node`
- âœ… Initialized my first project using `npm init`
- âœ… Installed and used the `slugify` package


I installed Node.js on my system, which lets me run JavaScript code outside the browser. Using the terminal, I executed my first .js file with the command node filename.js, and it was awesome to see it work!

I also learned about npm (Node Package Manager) and how it helps in managing packages. I initialized my first Node project with npm init, which created a package.json file. This file stores important project details and keeps track of the dependencies I install.

Next, I installed a random package called slugify using npm install slugify. It helps in converting strings into URL-friendly slugs. To use it, I wrote this in my code:
const slugify = require("slugify");
<pre> <code>
console.log(slugify("My First Backend Project")); 
</code> </pre>
