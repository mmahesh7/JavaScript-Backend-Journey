CommonJS:

Used primarily in Node.js..

Modules are imported using require() and exported with module.exports.

It is synchronous, meaning it loads modules one after anotherâ€”ideal for server-side development.

==============================================================================

EcmaScript Modules (ESM):

A standardized JavaScript module system supported by modern browsers.

Uses import and export syntax.

Asynchronous and suitable for frontend environments as well as newer Node.js versions.

=================================================================================

Differences Highlighted:

Syntax variations (require vs. import).

Scope: CommonJS is specific to Node.js, while ES Modules are cross-platform.

Performance: ESM allows for better optimization.
